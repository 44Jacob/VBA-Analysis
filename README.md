# VBA-Analysis
The provided VBA code is designed to analyze stock data across multiple worksheets in an Excel workbook. Here's a walkthrough of what the code does:

Optimization: The code begins by turning off ScreenUpdating to speed up the macro execution. This is a common practice for long-running macros.

Worksheet Loop: It loops through each worksheet in the workbook. This allows the macro to perform the same set of operations on multiple sets of data.

Variable Initialization: Inside the loop, it initializes various variables, including summaryTableRow to keep track of where to write the summary results, and totalVolume to accumulate the volume of trades for each stock.

Data Analysis: It then proceeds to analyze the stock data, starting from the second row (assuming the first row contains headers). For each row, the macro does the following:

Checks if the ticker symbol has changed, indicating a new stock entry.
Calculates the yearly change and percentage change from the opening price (assumed to be in column C) to the closing price (assumed to be in column F).
Accumulates the total volume of the stock (assumed to be in column G).
Writes the ticker, yearly change, percentage change, and total volume to a summary table starting at column I (9).
Conditional Formatting: After analyzing each stock, it applies conditional formatting to the yearly change values in the summary table. Positive changes are highlighted in green, while negative changes are highlighted in red.

Finalization: Once all worksheets are processed, it re-enables ScreenUpdating and displays a message box indicating that the stock data analysis is complete.

The code is structured to ensure that the data analysis is robust, accounting for potential division by zero errors and resetting variables appropriately when a new stock ticker is encountered.
